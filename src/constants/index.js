export const HERO_CONTENT = `I’m a passionate Front-End Developer with over 2 years of experience building responsive, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Proficient in modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Next.js, and Redux, I specialize in creating intuitive, user-centric interfaces and seamlessly integrating RESTful APIs to deliver impactful digital experiences that boost productivity and engagement.`;
export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I’m a Junior Software Engineer with a strong passion for crafting seamless, user-focused web applications that drive business growth and enhance customer satisfaction. With a solid foundation in React.js, Next.js, and state management tools like Context API and Redux Toolkit, I specialize in developing responsive, scalable, and high-performance solutions that work flawlessly across devices.

Currently, at Sparsh Communications, I focus on optimizing front-end performance using advanced techniques such as lazy loading, dynamic imports, and prefetching. I take pride in building accessible, dynamic interfaces using technologies like React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

Beyond my professional role, I’ve led innovative projects such as Traveller, Moboom, and a custom E-Commerce Platform, where I implemented advanced features like search, filtering, and real-time updates—boosting both user engagement and functional depth.

My technical toolkit includes JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, Redux, and modern frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. I’m also experienced in performance optimization, dynamic workflows, and Agile methodologies.

What truly excites me is the opportunity to blend technical expertise with creative problem-solving to deliver meaningful solutions that align with user needs and business goals. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new technologies, studying design systems, or diving into a good tech blog.`;
